`manage-packages.sh install | remove | clean | update`

* XDG share and state support
Use XDG_CONFIG ?? i.e ~/.local/share and ~/.local/state

* [TODO] Scripts

`bootstrap` - ensure dependencies are installed
`cleanup` - remove old and unused packages
`diagnose` - report on problems with this setup
`setup` - ensure a working state
`test` - run the test suite
